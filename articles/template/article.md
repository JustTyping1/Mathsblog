# The Fibonacci Sequence (Fibonacci)

The Fibonacci sequence is perhaps one of the most simple and yet complex parts of mathematics. To quickly recap, it is a numerical sequence that traditionally begins 0, 1 and every next term is the sum of the two before. So, continuing the sequence, we get 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on.
While this may seem very simple, this sequence conceals a world of fascinating connections and patterns that show us that while mathematics is viewed as a very abstract and theoretical field, can have many connections, many times found in unexpected places.

Firstly, the Fibonacci sequence has been used, quite often as an approximation of the miles to kilometre conversion, and while this is arbitrary, it is useful. If you want to quickly convert 5 miles to kilometres, you look at the next term in the sequence, 8. This is a decent approximation
of the converted value. However, this is only the beginning. One may note, for example, that the ratio of a term in the sequence and the term before I appears to get closer and closer to a specific value as you go up in the sequence. As it turns out, mathematicians have named this number "phi" and
have designated it its own special Greek letter. Unlike "pi" (which it can sometimes be confused for, given the similar name), phi can be expressed and is not transcendental. Phi is exactly equal to (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.61803, but why is this number (and by extension the Fibonacci sequence) so special? One of the reasons is that we see it all throughout nature.

Let us picture a snail shell, with its mesmerizing spiral. It can be constructed mathematically by first drawing two 1 by 1 square vertically touching. Then constructing a 2 by two off to the right of the two squares so that it's side length is the sum of the side lengths of the first two. Now we repeat this, continuing in a spiral pattern.
We end up seeing that the side lengths of all the squares in order match the Fibonacci sequence. This makes sense as the side of any new square is the sum of the sides of the two squares before. Another observation we may make is that the rectangle has a side length ratio of 1:Φ (phi). This also seems to make sense. Now we draw a spiral through each of the squares such that it goes through the common vertices
and with this, we have constructed a snail shell pattern using the Fibonacci sequence, and that's not all! We can even scale this up from a snail shell to arms of entire spiral galaxies, like the milky way and observe the same phenomenon!

So, to conclude, the Fibonacci sequence is one of the many ideas in mathematics that can endlessly be discussed and spout debate as well as discovery, but, more than all else, it proves that mathematics is a field built into the very core of the universe, nature and even human behaviour. So, the next time you walk past a snail or a flower or even perhaps ponder the shape of the galaxy, be sure to remember phi and the humble series that starts 0, 1, 1.
